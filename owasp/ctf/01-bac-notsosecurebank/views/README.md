# NotSoSecureBank - Training Application

## Overview

NotSoSecureBank is an intentionally insecure web application designed for educational and training purposes. It provides a safe environment for cybersecurity enthusiasts, students, and professionals to practice identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities.

## Context

This application simulates a banking platform with typical features such as user authentication, account management, and transaction handling. However, it contains several security flaws that are commonly found in real-world applications. These vulnerabilities are deliberately introduced to help users understand how attackers exploit them and how to secure applications effectively.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:

- Provide hands-on experience in identifying and exploiting security vulnerabilities.
- Enhance understanding of secure coding practices and application hardening.
- Foster a deeper appreciation for the importance of cybersecurity in software development.

**Disclaimer:** This application is for educational purposes only. Do not deploy it in a production environment or use it for malicious purposes. Always adhere to ethical guidelines and legal boundaries when practicing cybersecurity skills.

Happy learning and hacking responsibly!
