# Notes about the notation

-   A simple dash (`-`) indicates a notion on the slide.
    
-   A digit with a dash (`1 -`, `2 -`, etc.) indicates a main chapter of the presentation.
    
-   A digit dot digit with a dash (`4.1 -`, `4.2 -`, etc.) indicates a slide inside that chapter.
    
-   A digit dot `X` with a dash (`5.X -`) indicates one or several slides on a subject, depending on needs.
    

# Slide plan

	-   CIA impact table with vulnerability level
	    

3 - More detailed presentation of the vulnerability  
	3.1 - More detailed presentation (family, attack source, part of the system targeted — infra, front-end, back-end, DB, etc.)  
	3.x - One or multiple example scenarios that exploit this vulnerability

4 - Discovering the vulnerability  
	4.1 - Where to look for this type of vulnerability (front-end, back-end, inputs, headers, etc.)  
	4.2 - Warning signs that should prompt investigation  
	4.3 - How to verify the presence of this type of vulnerability (inspection, fuzzing, proxy)  
	4.4 - Tools related to exploiting these vulnerabilities (SqlMap, Metasploit, ZAP, Burp)

5 - How to exploit the vulnerability  
	5.X - The conceptual principles behind exploitation  
	5.X - A practical case with a demo in a controlled lab

6 - Why the vulnerability appears

8 - Practice and experimentation, CTF & F (Capture The Flag & Fix) exercise  
	8.1 - Presentation of the "CTF" challenge students will solve, including:
		-   Name
		    
		-   Lore and objectives
		    
		-   URL / logins / etc. if necessary
		    
		-   Expected duration
	    
		-   Reminder that once the vulnerability is exploited they must find how to fix it and propose a patch on GitHub  

    8.2 - Demonstration of the exploitation:
		-   Live demo
